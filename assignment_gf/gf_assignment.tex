\maketitle
\begin{enumerate}



\item Find the generating function for the number of integer solutions to the equation $c_1+c_2+c_3+c_4=20$ where $-3\leq c_1, -3 \leq c_2, -5 \leq c_3 \leq 5,0\leq c_4$

\item In how many ways can 2 dozen identical robots be assigned to 4 assembly lines with 
	\begin{enumerate} \item at least 3 robots assigned to each line?  \item at least 3, but not more than 9 robots assigned to each line?  \end{enumerate}
\item In how many ways can 3000 identical envelops be divided, in packages of 25, among 4 student groups so that each group gets at least 150, but not more than 1000 of the envelops?

\item In how many ways can we select 7 non-consecutive integers from $\{1,2,3\dots , 50\}$? 
\item In $f(x)=[1/(1-x)][1/(1-x^2)][1/(1-x^3)]$, the co-efficient of $x^6$ is 7. Interpret this result in terms of partitions of 6. 

\item Show that the number of partitions of a positive integer $n$ where no summand appears more than twice equals the number of partitions of $n$ where no summand is divisible by 3.

\item Show that the number of partitions of $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, where no summand is divisible by 4 = the number of partitions of $n$ where no even summand is repeated (although odd summands may or may not be repeated).

\item Using a Ferrers graph, show that the number of partitions of an integer $n$ into summands not exceeding $n$ is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into at most $m$ summands.

\item Find the exponential generating function for the sequence $0!, 1!, 2!,3!,\dots$
