\date{24th \& 25th January 2017}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{enumerate}
    \item State the pigeon hole principle.
    \item Show that given a sequence of $n^2+1$ positive integers, one can always find a subsequence of length $n+1$ in increasing or decreasing order. Note the usage of the pigeon hole principle.
    \item Show that loseless compression is theoretically impossible to achieve.
    \item If $54$ students who are crediting this course, stand up and start shaking hands with others, randomly, is there a possibility that no two people shake hands the same number of times?
    \item Show that given an odd integer $m$, there always exists an integer $n$ such that $m|2^n-1$.
    \item Let $S=\{1,2,3,\dots,200\}$, pick 101 distinct elements randomly from this set, say T=${a_1,a_2,\dots,a_101}$. Show that one can always find two elements in $T$ such that one divides the other.
    \item Given that five points lie on a sphere, prove that there exists a closed semi-sphere, which contains 4 of the points. Note that semi-sphere includes the boundary.
    \item Given 5 points in a square with side 1 cm, show that one can always find two points who are less than or equal to $2sqrt(2)$ cm apart. 
    \item Show that there are at least two women men in Ropar who have the same amount of hair strands :-).
    \item State and prove the extended pigeon hole principle. 
    \item Show that given 6 people, you can always find 3 people who know each other or 3 people who don't know each other.
    \item A lady checks at least 1 and at most 132 matrimonial profiles per day for the next 11 weeks. Show that there is a sequence of successive $k$ days, for some k, where she has dated $21$ people.
