                </div>
                  <p>This is a prerequisite course for almost all subjects/topics of computer science that you will study in the forthcoming semester. The word discrete in discrete mathematics has dual meaning: one being an antonym of the word continuous, which signifies, we are going to deal with the number line comprising of integers. The second being a discrete bunch of prerequisite topics for computer science, stitched together and offered as a subject. Most of the topics that will be covered in the course do not assume any prerequisites and our discussions will resemble puzzle solving sessions. The subject is very fascinating and it has been my observation that many graduating students regard this as one of their favourite subjects. Apart from aiding as a prerequisite to other courses, discrete mathematics helps in heightening the mathematical aptitude of a student. If you ever enjoyed puzzle solving, you will like the ride through this subject. The treatment of the subject is excellent in the prescribed text book (mentioned below). The text book gets to the level of a college fresher without assuming any preliminary knowledge. The motivation of concepts is through several worked examples which makes learning easy and fun. The textbook has a historical account that appears at the end of every chapter, which I recommend you all to read without fail. There are several nice books and popular science articles on this subject which I can pass on to you people if you are interested. You are encouraged to read up extra material and discuss the same with the course instructor and TA beyond the class and office hours. We sincerely hope that you enjoy this course at its fullest.

                <p><b>Primary Textbook</b>
                <br>The textbook for the course is <i>Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics, 5th Edition by Ralph P. Grimaldi</i>. We will cover most of the chapters from this text book. This book is available on Flipkart and Amazon. I personally liked the e-version of the book which is available for a nominal price on Amazon (click <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Combinatorial-Mathematics-Pearson-International-ebook/dp/B00IZ0L3XU/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=">here,</a>). This e-version opens on your desktop/tablet. I strongly suggest that you buy an e-version instead of a hard copy as it helps you annotate the text and helps you search through the text easily. There is a third version of this book available as a PDF document online (if you google), although I am not sure whether this is a legal or a pirated one.

                <p>With the intention of protecting the interest of students and fostering a dynamic learning experience, the instructor plans to set up the following mechanisms/protocols to ensure that the students get the best from this course:</p>
                
                <p> 1. In case the student finds it difficult to understand any of the concepts covered in the class, s/he is requested to email the instructor asking for help within 5 working days from the day of the class. The instructor along with the TA will make sincere attempts to ensure that a time is scheduled within the next 1 week to clarify the doubt or redo that part of teaching, if required. </p>
                
                <p> 2. Irrespective of the official/personal commitments of the instructor, the instructor will stick to the scheduled date/time of the class and will never prepone or postpone the class’ date/time under any circumstance. The instructor will never schedule an extra class beyond the scheduled class hours. If there is a need for one, the instructor will record a few video lectures and pass it on to everyone well in advance, which will serve as a replacement for the extra classes. </p>
                
                <p> 3. Irrespective of any academic/official/personal engagements, the instructor will ensure that he is present in the class before the commencement time of the class. In no case will the instructor be late by even a minute. Also, under no circumstance will the instructor continue to engage the class a minute beyond the scheduled 50 minutes.</p>
                
                <p> 4. The instructor will strictly stick to the list of topics presented in the table in the same order to the best possible extent.</p>
                
                <p> 5. The instructor maintains an anonymous feedback form at the following link: <a href="http://goo.gl/n6P27i">http://goo.gl/n6P27i</a>. You are requested to post your concerns/complaints/feedback here. Every feedback we receive will be discussed in the class and solved. 
                
                <p> 6.The instructor will, under no cost, change the marks distribution, syllabus or introduce any perk/point not listed in this document. after 10th of January 2017.</p>
                
                <p> 7. The instructor guarantees that the tutorial sheets will serve as a model for the kind of questions that will appear in the tests and exams. The student should never be in the state of not knowing how to prepare and what to prepare. You are guaranteed to do very well if you are attending the classes, reading all the topics from the references provided and solving all the tutorial problems.</p>
                
                <p> 8. The course assumes that the student is spending about 4 to 5 hours per week outside the class hours in understanding the subject material. In case the student is struggling beyond these many hours, it can be detrimental to his/her overall progress in the semester. In such a situation, you are requested to meet the instructor at the earliest possible time by fixing an appointment. The instructor will evaluate your preparedness for the topics covered in the course and will advise you on ways to improve your understanding of the course content. </p>

                 </div>
                
                <p><strong>Q1. The marks distribution looks strangely different. Why?</strong>
                <br>
                It is observed that there are two categories of students, ones who perform consistently well and the ones who are slow bloomers. Respecting this, the instructor has decided to evaluate a student in two different ways and take the maximum of the two distributions. For instance, if you end up securing less marks in the minor exam, you will still have hopes to perform well in the major exam and compensate for it because we will consider track 1 distribution. If you are a consistent student and have done well in the minor but not so well in the major, you are well protected by the track 2 distribution. Please note that the marks distribution is final and there will be no changes to it.

                <strong>Q2. Why are there no assignments in this course?</strong><br>
                While the instructor understands that the homework assignments give the students a different kind of learning advantage in comparison to the time bound tests/exams, it was noted in the past that the plagiarism/copying related strategies which a few students resort to, give them unwarranted edge over the faithful and sincere ones. To protect the interests of sincere students, the instructor has decided to not have a homework component in the course.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Q3. I learn the best when I am given homeworks/assignments. How else will a student get to achieve depth if one does not solve assignment or homework problems at one’s own pace?</strong><br>
                The instructor completely understands this point and strongly believes that the students should spend quality time in solving problem sets with varying difficulty levels. In this connection, we will ensure that problem sets are given in the form of tutorial-sheets well in advance to students so that they spend time solving them independently/collaboratively. After about a week, these questions will be discussed and solved in the Tutorial sessions by the TA/instructor. It is important for the student to be self motivated enough to attempt the questions provided in the tutorial-sheet. The questions in the tutorial-sheet are indicative of the difficulty level of the questions that will be asked in the tests and exams. In fact, a few questions in the minor/major will be directly picked from these tutorial-sheets. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>Q4. How do I ensure that I perform well in this course?</strong><br>
                You are more likely to get a very good grade if you do the following: 
                Attend the lectures, follow up with the instructor and TA if you don’t understand a concept. 
                Solve the problem sets given in the form of tutorial sheets before coming to the tutorial classes.
                Ensure that you understand the topics by reading the material from the references provided.
                Take the quizzes seriously, which will help you stay with the pace of the classes.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Q5. I am not sure what is the actual course load. What if it gets heavy and affects my overall semester’s progress.</strong><br>
                This is very unlikely, given that the instructor has made every attempt to keep the course organized with deviations minimized. Beyond this, at any point of time, if you think you are struggling with the course, you should talk to the instructor/TA immediately, we can take a closer look at your problem and with a “high probability” solve it for you. The course is all about probabilistic solutions to problems which the instructor and TA seem to be a little versed with :-)
                <br><br>
                <strong>Q6. If I have a serious complaint with the way the course is conducted or if there is any other issue which I cannot directly convey, fearing that it can be mistaken for insubordination, how do I go about it?</strong><br>
                Despite our best efforts, if there is something that you don’t like about the way the course is conducted (by the instructor or by the TA), be it teaching/evaluation/partiality, you may please use the anonymous link to post your grievance: <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/pPJKQvSLwJ9mFpNx2">http://goo.gl/forms/pPJKQvSLwJ9mFpNx2</a> . We will immediately act on it with the benefit of doubt, always given to the students. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>Q7.  I am into extra curricular activities and cannot give a whole lot of time for studies, do you think i will be risking it by taking up this elective?</strong><br>
                Extra curricular activities are as important as academics. We encourage you to participate and suggest that you strike a good balance between the two. In order to encourage the students to spend good amount of time in their holistic development outside academics, the CSL105 course is structured in a way that we don’t expect beyond 4 to 5 hours of your study time per week, which amounts to 56 hrs to 70 hrs in the semester.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Q8. What will be asked in the quizzes? Will it be surprise or announced?</strong><br>
                Quizzes will test your understanding of the concepts, it will be of short duration and straightforward questions. Anyone who has sat through the lectures can easily answer them. Every quiz will be pre-announced by at least a day’s time in advance (over email). There will be 1 to 2 quizzes every week each of 5 to 10 mins duration. More details about the quiz will be shared on the first day of the class.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Q9. Is the grading in the tests/exams boolean or do we get marks for partial attempts?</strong><br>
                The valuation (/marking) scheme and solution to the test/exam questions will be shared with everyone. The marking will not be boolean, you will get marks for partial attempts as described in the scheme of valuation.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Q10. I love programming! I don’t see any programming component in this elective. Why?</strong><br>
                We feel the course is already heavy for 4 credits, including a programming component will tax the student a bit too much. We will be giving you interesting programming questions and exploratory assignments to try by yourself, these will not be graded.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Q11. How are the grade letters assigned in this course?</strong><br>
                It has been our sincere observation from our experience so far that it is tough to decide the grading mechanism a priori and do justice to students. The instructor will decide on the grade letter breakups after observing the final performance of the students. The grading will be fair, in the sense that, it  will distinguish students on the basis of their understanding and efforts. Every attempt will be made in ensuring that the evaluation is such that the “naturally talented”, “high IQ-ed” and “intelligent” students will not have an undue advantage over a “hardworking” and “sincere” student.

We saw the importance to have different ways to represent a poset. We briefly saw the need for a technique like that of  Topological sorting. </td>
