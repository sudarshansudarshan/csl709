\title{Tutorial 3 - Functions and Relations}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Six cars, each of different colors \textcolor{indigo}{I}, \textcolor{blue}{B}, \textcolor{green}{G}, \textcolor{yellow}{Y}, \textcolor{orange}{O}, \textcolor{red}{R} are to race. In how many ways can they hit the finish line.?
\item You obviously assumed that no two cars can end up in a tie. What if we were to conside the case where ties are possible? The answer isn't obvious! We will solve this question by the end of this tutorial.
\item Define a binary relation from $A$ to $B$.
\item What are the total number of relations from $A$ to $B$, assuming these sets to be finite?
\item What are the total number of relations on a given finite set $S$?
\item Show that every function is a relation, but not conversely.
\item What are the total number of functions $f: A\rightarrow B $, given that $A$ and $B$ are finite sets?
\item What are the total number of 1-1 functions from $A$ to $B$?
\item What are the total number of onto functions from $A$ to $B$, given that $|A|=3$ and $|B|=2$?
\item Answer the above question with $|A|=4$ and $|B|=3$.
\item Do you observe a pattern from the previous two questions? What is the answer in general, for $|A|=m$ and $|B|=n$?
\item What is the total number of ways you can put $m$ distinct balls into $n$ identical containers?
\item Show that $S(m+1,n)=S(m,n-1)+nS(m,n)$.
\item Use the above formula to find $S(6,4)$.
\item Can you now answer the first question?
\item In how many ways can we factor 30030?
\item Observe that the answer for the first question and the previous question is the same. Why?
