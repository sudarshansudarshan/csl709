                </div>
                  <p> This is an advanced course that deals with the study of several complex networks. The aim will be to understand the structural properties that are commonly present across several complex networks, and their implications to the system. This course will also give you the opportunity to perform investigations on real world complex networks.    
                  </p>
                <p><b>Primary Textbook</b>
                <br>The textbook for the course is <i>Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World,David Easley and Jon Kleinberg</i>. We will cover most of the chapters from this text book. This book is available on Flipkart and Amazon.

				    <td> A.&nbsp <i>Rank Me Thou Shalln’t Compare Me!</i>: <br>
We are humans and humans always compare. We measure our importance in terms of others whether it’s money, grades, profit, or loss. In complex networks like, online social networks, WWW network, collaboration networks, a node can be interested in finding its importance just by computing its ranking in the network. Many centrality measures, like degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, coreness, pagerank have been coined to measure the importance of a node based on different application context. But to get the exact ranking of a node, we need entire network. With time, size of real world complex networks is increasing exponentially. It is infeasible to completely collect, store, and process these networks. In the current project, we estimate the global ranking of a node using its local information. Ranking can be based on any centrality measure depending on the requirement. We focus on proposing algorithms that use local information of the node and other properties of the real world networks, like power law degree distribution, high clustering coefficient, small world phenomenon, assortativity, and so on. This will be a new direction of approximation algorithm in complex networks.

				    <td> A.&nbsp <i>The Truth or Falsehood of Zodiac Sign Compatibility</i>: <br>
The term zodiac is derived from the Latin word “zodiacus” that translates to “the circle of animals”. The concept of zodiac signs is found commonly across western, hindu as well as the chinese astrology. Each practise of astrology advocates the strength of compatibility of the various zodiac signs. For example, you might not be surprised to hear that arranged marriages across India follow hindu astrology to check for the zodiac sign compatibility of the couple, prior to marriage. The practice of astrology, which dates back to the 2nd millennium BCE, many objections have been raised against the practise. <br>
The aim of this project is to validate or debunk the zodiac sign compatibility claims. In order to do so, we study the social network of a large group of individuals (ex: IIT ropar students) with the intention of analysing the strength of relationships depicting friendship/enmity among the individuals. Gathering such true relationship data from real world, while preserving privacy, would allow to comment on the truth/falsehood of the astrological claims. Hence, the project is twofold consisting of data collection and social network analysis.<br><br>  </td>

				    <td> B.&nbsp <i>Secure Social Network Analysis</i>: <br>
Social network analysis as a technique has been applied to a diverse set of fields, including, organizational behavior, sociology, economics and biology. However, for sensitive networks such as hate networks, trust networks and sexual networks, these techniques have been sparsely used. This is majorly attributed to the unavailability of network data. Anonymization is the most commonly used technique for performing privacy preserving network analysis. The process involves the presence of a trusted third party, who is aware of the complete network, and releases a sanitized version of it. Literature points to several drawbacks that the technique suffers from. <br>
The current project looks at an alternative solution, in which, the desired analysis can be performed in a distributed setting, such that : (a) no central third party is required; (b) the topology of the underlying network is kept hidden. The key is to design data oblivious algorithms for securely performing various social network analysis methods. It then can be translated to designing secure multiparty computation protocols to achieve the same. <br><br></td>

 <br>
This project is about analyzing the publicly available data dump of Wikipedia. We already have past literature that looks into the completeness of a crowdsourced enumeration query where different users in the crowd give an answer to a query that has answer in the form of a list. For example, I ask 10 people to list the names of restaurants in Ropar. I keep track of the names that these people give me and keep updating a list of unique names. The question is, if I have no knowledge about Ropar, when should I stop taking answers from these people to be sure that the list is, say, 80 percent complete. The proposed project is about exploiting a similar concept to measure the completeness of wikipedia articles by analyzing the frequencies of edits that happen in the articles.

: <br>
7.9 billion pageviews, 3.7 million question asked, 4.6 million answers submitted…, these are the statistics of one of the world's most famous technical question and answer (Q/A) site named as Stack Exchange. Q/A sites are getting famous day by day. People come there not only to get technical knowledge but to seek advice, satisfy their curiosity for just about anything in life and collect different opinions. It has become a great platform for people to come and share their knowledge with each other. Some such platforms are Stack Exchange communities, Quora and Wikipedia. These websites provide us with huge amount of data dump which is open for analysis. This project is about analyzing this data and answer various questions related to knowledge building, crowdsourcing, user interaction etc. <br><br></td>

As an introduction to the Pagerank algorithm, we first began by understanding the notion of associating importance of a node to the sum of the importances of its friends (nodes with in-links to it). In this regard we defined a stable assignment as the distribution of strength of each node such that the value for a node is precisely equal to the strengths of its neighbours. We then observed through examples that a repeated improvement technique of redistributing strengths converges to the stable assignment. We also looked at the repeated application of a matrix on a random vector converges in the direction of the eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue. </td>
