                  <p> This is an advanced course that deals with the study of several complex networks. The aim will be understand the structural properties that are commonly present across several complex networks, and their implications to the system. This course will also give you the opportunity to perform investigations on real world complex networks.

                     <a id="learners-armour" class="anchor" href="#earners-armour" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LEARNERS ARMOUR</h2>

                <p>With the intention of protecting the interest of students and fostering a dynamic learning experience, the instructor plans to set up the following mechanisms/protocols to ensure that the students get the best from this course:</p>
                
                <p> 1. In case the student finds it difficult to understand any of the concepts covered in the class, s/he is requested to email the instructor asking for help within 5 working days from the day of the class. The instructor along with the TA will make sincere attempts to ensure that a time is scheduled within the next 1 week to clarify the doubt or redo that part of teaching, if required. </p>
                
                <p> 2. Irrespective of the official/personal commitments of the instructor, the instructor will stick to the scheduled date/time of the class and will never prepone or postpone the classâ€™ date/time under any circumstance. The instructor will never schedule an extra class beyond the scheduled class hours. If there is a need for one, the instructor will record a few video lectures and pass it on to everyone well in advance, which will serve as a replacement for the extra classes. </p>
                
                <p> 3. Irrespective of any academic/official/personal engagements, the instructor will ensure that he is present in the class before the commencement time of the class. In no case will the instructor be late by even a minute. Also, under no circumstance will the instructor continue to engage the class a minute beyond the scheduled 50 minutes.</p>
                
                <p> 4. The instructor will strictly stick to the list of topics presented in the table in the same order to the best possible extent.</p>
                
                <p> 5. The instructor maintains an anonymous feedback form at the following link: <a href="http://goo.gl/n6P27i">http://goo.gl/n6P27i</a>. You are requested to post your concerns/complaints/feedback here. Every feedback we receive will be discussed in the class and solved. 
                
                <p> 6.The instructor will, under no cost, change the marks distribution, syllabus or introduce any perk/point not listed in this document. after 10th of January 2017.</p>
                
                <p> 7. The instructor guarantees that the tutorial sheets will serve as a model for the kind of questions that will appear in the tests and exams. The student should never be in the state of not knowing how to prepare and what to prepare. You are guaranteed to do very well if you are attending the classes, reading all the topics from the references provided and solving all the tutorial problems.</p>
                
                <p> 8. The course assumes that the student is spending about 4 to 5 hours per week outside the class hours in understanding the subject material. In case the student is struggling beyond these many hours, it can be detrimental to his/her overall progress in the semester. In such a situation, you are requested to meet the instructor at the earliest possible time by fixing an appointment. The instructor will evaluate your preparedness for the topics covered in the course and will advise you on ways to improve your understanding of the course content. </p>
