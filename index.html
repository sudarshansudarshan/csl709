                </div>
                  <p> This is an advanced course that deals with the study of several complex networks. The aim will be to understand the structural properties that are commonly present across several complex networks, and their implications to the system. This course will also give you the opportunity to perform investigations on real world complex networks.    
                  </p>
                <p><b>Primary Textbook</b>
                <br>The textbook for the course is <i>Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World,David Easley and Jon Kleinberg</i>. We will cover most of the chapters from this text book. This book is available on Flipkart and Amazon.

As an introduction to the Pagerank algorithm, we first began by understanding the notion of associating importance of a node to the sum of the importances of its friends (nodes with in-links to it). In this regard we defined a stable assignment as the distribution of strength of each node such that the value for a node is precisely equal to the strengths of its neighbours. We then observed through examples that a repeated improvement technique of redistributing strengths converges to the stable assignment. We also looked at the repeated application of a matrix on a random vector converges in the direction of the eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue. </td>
